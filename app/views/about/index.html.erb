  	  <p>Linkvan.ca is a mobile-optimized website that connects community residents in the Downtown Eastside to nearby resources.  Focusing on basic services such as access to shelter, food, medical care, hygiene services, advocacy and technology access, Linkvan.ca was designed with two user groups in mind: <br>
  	  	<ol>
  	  		<li> A growing population of low-income Downtown Eastsiders who rely on mobile technology to meet their basic needs</li>
  	  		<li>Service providers who can use information to direct clients in need.</li>
  	  	</ol>
Linkvan.ca was created in collaboration with Kevin Tanyag (Programmer), William Booth, Dionne Pelan, Haydn Mellowship, Melissa Kuipers, Roohi Sahajpal, Felix Tso (Programmer), Diane Campbell (Ambassador), Wilson Liang (Ambassador), <a href="http://dteslit.blogspot.ca/">DTES Literacy Roundtable</a>, <a href="http://www.learningexchange.ubc.ca/">UBC Learning Exchange</a>, community residents, and service providers, with financial support from the Chapman Innovation Grant through <a href="http://students.ubc.ca/about/centre-community-engaged-learning">UBC’s Centre for Community Engaged Learning.</a>
